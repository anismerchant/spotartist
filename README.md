### OVERVIEW
* Spotartist was a place where artists helped artists land gigs, share resources and skills, recruit each other to build projects, give advice, get input on ideas, become part of a local and global directory of artists â€” and collectively created unique experiences for communities everywhere.

* I conceived of the idea in late-2011 and started building it mid-2012. It went live in 2014 (beta) and remained actve until mid-2018. It helped connect artists from around the world. And it had a relatively decent following on Facebook. Curious? Here's a link to its defunct FB page: https://www.facebook.com/spotartist.

* In the future (when time permits), I'll be releasing its code as open source for others to use, to learn from, and make better, but for now it lives on in my private repository and localhost. If you would like to see it, feel at ease to contact me and I'll demo it for you.
