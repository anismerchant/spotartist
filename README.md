### OVERVIEW
* Spotartist was a place where artists helped artists land gigs, shared resources and skills, recruited each other to build projects, gave advice, got input on ideas, became part of a local and global directory of artists â€” and collectively created unique experiences for communities everywhere.

* I conceived of this idea in late-2011 and started building it mid-2012. It went live in 2014 (beta) and remained active until mid-2018. It helped connect artists from around the world. And it had a relatively decent following on Facebook. Curious? Here's a link to its defunct FB page: https://www.facebook.com/spotartist.
